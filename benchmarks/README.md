# Delta Kernel Benchmarking

This crate contains benchmarking infrastructure for Delta Kernel using Criterion and JSON workload specs. It is separate from the `kernel` crate to keep benchmark-specific code and dependencies out of the core library.

## Running benchmarks

```bash
# run all benchmarks
cargo bench -p delta_kernel_benchmarks

# run a specific bench binary
cargo bench -p delta_kernel_benchmarks --bench workload_bench

# filter to benchmarks whose name contains a substring (Criterion substring matching)
cargo bench -p delta_kernel_benchmarks --bench workload_bench "some_name"

# profile a benchmark and generate a flamegraph
cargo install samply
samply record cargo bench -p delta_kernel_benchmarks --bench workload_bench "some_name"
```

### Filtering benchmarks

#### By benchmark name

Benchmark names follow a hierarchical path structure assembled from the table name, the spec file name, the operation, and (for `Read` workloads) the read config name:

```
{table_name}/{spec_file_name}/{operation}/{config_name}
```

- `{table_name}` — the `name` field from `tableInfo.json`
- `{spec_file_name}` — the spec filename without its `.json` extension (the `case_name`)
- `{operation}` — `snapshotConstruction` or `readMetadata`
- `{config_name}` — only present for `Read` workloads; e.g. `serial`, `parallel2`, `parallel4`

All path components use camelCase to match the JSON keys used throughout the workload spec format.

Examples:
```
101kAdds1000CommitsSinceChkpt1Chkpt/snapshotLatest/snapshotConstruction
101kAdds1000CommitsSinceChkpt1Chkpt/snapshotLatest/readMetadata/serial
10kAdds0CommitsSinceChkpt1V2Chkpt/snapshotLatest/readMetadata/parallel2
```

The filter argument is a regular expression, so you can create patterns to target the benchmarks that you want:

```bash
# all benchmarks for a specific table name
cargo bench -p delta_kernel_benchmarks --bench workload_bench "101kAdds1000CommitsSinceChkpt1Chkpt"

# all benchmarks for either of two tables (| for OR)
cargo bench -p delta_kernel_benchmarks --bench workload_bench "101kAdds1000CommitsSinceChkpt1Chkpt|10kAdds0Chkpts"

# all snapshotConstruction benchmarks
cargo bench -p delta_kernel_benchmarks --bench workload_bench "snapshotConstruction"

# snapshotConstruction workloads for a specific table (.* to AND two parts of the name)
cargo bench -p delta_kernel_benchmarks --bench workload_bench "101kAdds1000CommitsSinceChkpt1Chkpt.*snapshotConstruction"

# profile a specific benchmark with samply
samply record cargo bench -p delta_kernel_benchmarks --bench workload_bench "101kAdds1000CommitsSinceChkpt1Chkpt/snapshotLatest/snapshotConstruction"
```

#### By tag (`BENCH_TAGS`)

Set the `BENCH_TAGS` environment variable to a comma-separated list of tags to run only tables whose `tags` field (in `tableInfo.json`) contains at least one matching tag. If `BENCH_TAGS` is unset or empty, all tables are loaded and benchmarked.

```bash
# run only tables tagged "base"
BENCH_TAGS=base cargo bench -p delta_kernel_benchmarks
```

Built-in tags (with current table assignments - for the most up-to-date table assignments, run benchmarks locally and inspect `benchmarks/workloads/benchmarks/<any-existing-table-name>/tableInfo.json` to learn about the existing tables):
- **`base`** — a base set of tables run in CI
  - Tables: `101kAdds1kCommitsSinceChkpt1Chkpt`
- **`commit-size-scaling`** — tables for comparing how log replay time scales with the number of actions in the log; all are single-commit tables with varying action counts (100, 1k, 10k, 100k, 1M)
  - Tables: `100Adds0Chkpts`, `1kAdds0Chkpts`, `10kAdds0Chkpts`, `100kAdds0Chkpts`, `1MAddsNoData0Chkpts`
- **`checkpoint-reads-by-type`** — tables for comparing checkpoint reading performance for different kinds of checkpointing
  - Tables: `10kAdds0CommitsSinceChkpt1Chkpt`, `10kAdds0CommitsSinceChkpt1V2Chkpt`
- **`v2-checkpoint`** — tables with v2 checkpoints
  - Tables: `10kAdds0CommitsSinceChkpt1V2Chkpt`
- **`crc-optimization`** — tables for comparing how CRC files affect log replay timing; designed to isolate the effect of CRC files at different versions relative to the checkpoint and latest version
  - Tables: `101kAdds1kCommitsSinceChkpt1Chkpt`, `20kAdds100CommitsSinceChkpt1Chkpt0CommitsSinceCrc`, `20kAdds100CommitsSinceChkpt1Chkpt50CommitsSinceCrc`, `20kAdds100CommitsSinceChkpt1ChkptNoCrc`
- **`time-travel-optimization`** — tables with multiple specs or specs not at the latest version, useful for benchmarking snapshot construction at historical versions
  - Tables: `101kAdds1kCommitsSinceChkpt1Chkpt`, `200kAdds0CommitsSinceChkpt2Chkpts0CommitsSinceCrc`
- **`listing-optimization`** — table for benchmarking log listing efficiency (e.g. `list_from()` call patterns); useful for features that optimize how the delta log directory is scanned
  - Tables: `200kAdds0CommitsSinceChkpt2Chkpts0CommitsSinceCrc`
- **`metadata-only`** — tables with no actual data files, useful for isolating log metadata processing overhead
  - Tables: `1MAddsNoData0Chkpts`


You can also add custom tags to the `tags` field of any local `tableInfo.json` to group tables relevant to your work, then pass that tag via `BENCH_TAGS` without modifying any code:

```bash
BENCH_TAGS=my-feature cargo bench -p delta_kernel_benchmarks

# run all tables tagged either "base" or "my-feature"
BENCH_TAGS=base,my-feature cargo bench -p delta_kernel_benchmarks
```

### Running benchmarking on a PR

Benchmarks run automatically on every push to a non-draft PR with `BENCH_TAGS=base`, no filter.
Results are posted as a single PR comment that updates in place on each push, so the latest
comment always reflects the latest commit. The comment is posted by a companion
`workflow_run`-triggered workflow ([benchmark-post-comment.yml](../.github/workflows/benchmark-post-comment.yml)),
so the bench job itself runs with a read-only token even on fork PRs. To bench a draft PR or
override the tags or filter, post a `/bench` comment as documented below -- it updates the
same comment that the auto-trigger uses.

The bench job fails if any benchmark is at least 15% slower than the base branch. The result
comment is still posted so you can see which benchmark regressed. To merge anyway (for an
expected or noise-driven regression), add the `ignore-benchmark-failure` label to the PR.

To trigger benchmarks on a pull request manually, post a comment using the following syntax:

```
/bench [--tags <comma separated list of tags>] [--filter <regex>]
```

- `--tags` sets `BENCH_TAGS` (comma-separated), controlling which table groupings run.
- `--filter` is a single-token Criterion regex matched against benchmark names.
- Both flags are optional and independent; they can be given in any order.
- When both are specified, they apply as AND: only benchmarks from tables that match the tag filter AND whose name matches the regex are run.
- Running just `/bench` (with no flags) defaults to `BENCH_TAGS=base`. If neither flag is parsed, the same default applies.

Examples:
```
/bench                                                  # BENCH_TAGS=base, all benchmark names
/bench --tags base,my-tag                               # BENCH_TAGS=base,my-tag, all benchmark names
/bench --filter snapshotConstruction                    # no BENCH_TAGS set, only snapshotConstruction benchmarks
/bench --tags base --filter 101kAdds.*snapshotConstruction  # only snapshotConstruction benchmarks from tables tagged "base"
/bench --filter 101kAdds|10kAdds                        # no BENCH_TAGS set, OR two table names
```

See [By tag (`BENCH_TAGS`)](#by-tag-bench_tags) for how tags work and [By benchmark name](#by-benchmark-name) for regex pattern examples. Results are posted automatically as a PR comment, comparing the PR branch against the base branch.
CI timings are noisy and tend to run higher than on dedicated hardware, but proportional differences between branches are a rough signal for performance changes.

## Workload data layout

Each table lives in its own subdirectory under `benchmarks/workloads/benchmarks/`:

```
benchmarks/workloads/
├── benchmarks/
│   └── <table_name>/
│       ├── tableInfo.json        # describes the table (name, schema, protocol, etc.)
│       ├── delta/                # Delta table data (if no explicit tablePath)
│       └── specs/
│           └── <case_name>.json  # one file per benchmark operation
└── tests/                        # reserved for future test workloads (currently empty)
```

## Loading workloads

Workloads are downloaded from the DAT GitHub release and extracted to `benchmarks/workloads/` automatically by `build.rs` when the crate is built. A `.done` marker file is written on success to skip re-downloading on subsequent builds. To force a fresh download, delete `benchmarks/workloads/.done`.

Workloads are discovered automatically by path. `load_all_workloads()` scans every subdirectory of `benchmarks/workloads/benchmarks/`, loading `tableInfo.json` and every spec file under `specs/`. The spec filename (without extension) becomes the `case_name`.

## Current benchmarking workloads

There is no single exhaustive list of all benchmark tables and their contents maintained in this README, as this can change over time. The [built-in tags](#by-tag-bench_tags) section includes a list of table names grouped by tag, but this is non-exhaustive and subject to change. To explore which tables exist and what each one contains, run benchmarks locally and inspect the `tableInfo.json` file in each table's directory under `benchmarks/workloads/benchmarks/`.

## Adding a new table locally

### Local tables

To benchmark against a local Delta table:

1. Extract the workload archive if you haven't already — the simplest way is to run any benchmark once, which auto-extracts it:
   ```bash
   cargo bench -p delta_kernel_benchmarks --bench workload_bench
   ```
2. Create a directory for the new table under `benchmarks/workloads/benchmarks/`:
   ```
   benchmarks/data/workloads/benchmarks/<tableName>/
   ├── tableInfo.json       # see TableInfo section below for required fields
   ├── delta/               # Delta table files (_delta_log/, parquet data, etc.)
   └── specs/
       └── <case_name>.json # one or more spec files describing operations to benchmark
   ```
3. Run benchmarks — the new table is discovered automatically (you can filter by table name — see [By benchmark name](#by-benchmark-name)):
   ```bash
   cargo bench -p delta_kernel_benchmarks --bench workload_bench "<table_name>"
   ```

### Remote tables (S3 / UC)

Remote tables are benchmarked via `KERNEL_BENCH_WORKLOAD_DIR`, which points to a directory of
table configs outside of the workload archive. Each subdirectory has the same layout as local
tables (`tableInfo.json` + `specs/`), but no `delta/` directory is needed.

There are two types of remote tables, determined by the `tableInfo.json` fields:

- **S3 tables** — set `tablePath` to the S3 URL (e.g. `s3://bucket/path`). Requires `AWS_*`
  env vars for credentials.
- **UC tables** — set `catalogInfo` with a `tableName` field (e.g. `catalog.schema.table`).
  Credentials are vended via UC at runtime (`UC_WORKSPACE` / `UC_TOKEN` env vars). The
  benchmark harness automatically detects catalog-managed tables (via UC properties) and
  uses the appropriate snapshot loading path.

Example `tableInfo.json` for a UC table:
```json
{
  "name": "my_uc_table",
  "description": "A UC-managed table",
  "catalogInfo": {"tableName": "catalog.schema.table"},
  "schema": {"type": "struct", "fields": [...]},
  "protocol": {"minReaderVersion": 1, "minWriterVersion": 2},
  "logInfo": {"numAddFiles": 100, "numRemoveFiles": 0, "sizeInBytes": 0, "numCommits": 1, "numActions": 100},
  "properties": {},
  "dataLayout": {},
  "tags": []
}
```

Example:
```bash
KERNEL_BENCH_WORKLOAD_DIR=/path/to/my/tables \
  UC_WORKSPACE=https://my-workspace.cloud.databricks.com UC_TOKEN=... AWS_REGION=us-west-2 \
  cargo bench --bench workload_bench
```

## Entities

### `TableInfo`

Deserialized from `tableInfo.json`. Captures the table's identity (`name`, `description`), Delta schema and protocol, log statistics (`logInfo`), physical data layout, table properties, and benchmark tags. See [`src/models.rs`](src/models.rs) for field-level documentation.

#### Example

```json
{
  "name": "myTable",
  "description": "A basic table with two append writes.",
  "schema": {"type": "struct", "fields": [
    {"name": "id", "type": "long", "nullable": true, "metadata": {}}
  ]},
  "protocol": {"minReaderVersion": 3, "minWriterVersion": 7, "readerFeatures": [], "writerFeatures": []},
  "logInfo": {
    "numAddFiles": 10,
    "numRemoveFiles": 0,
    "sizeInBytes": 4096,
    "numCommits": 2,
    "numActions": 12
  },
  "properties": {},
  "dataLayout": {},
  "tags": ["base"]
}
```

### `Spec`

Deserialized from a JSON file in a table's `specs/` directory. Describes a single operation to benchmark (what to do, e.g. read at version 3). Two variants are supported:

- **`Read`** — scan a table at an optional version (defaults to latest). A single `Read` spec expands into one benchmark per `ReadOperation` × `ReadConfig` combination — every relevant operation and parallelism mode is benchmarked. Currently only `ReadMetadata` is implemented; `ReadData` is not yet supported.
- **`SnapshotConstruction`** — measure the cost of building a `Snapshot` from scratch at an optional version (defaults to latest)

Read specs:
```json
{
  "type": "read"
}
```
Or with a specific version:

```json
{
  "type": "read",
  "version": 0
}
```

With a predicate for data skipping (SQL WHERE clause syntax):

```json
{
  "type": "read",
  "predicate": "id < 500 AND value > 10"
}
```

The `predicate` field accepts a SQL WHERE clause expression that is parsed into a kernel `Predicate` and passed to the scan builder. See [`src/predicate_parser.rs`](src/predicate_parser.rs) for the full list of supported SQL features.

Snapshot construction specs:
```json
{
  "type": "snapshotConstruction"
}
```
Or with a specific version:

```json
{
  "type": "snapshotConstruction",
  "version": 0
}
```

### `Workload`

The concrete unit of work that gets benchmarked. Assembled when loading workloads by pairing a `Spec` (the operation) with a `TableInfo` (the table) and a `case_name`. A `Spec` file on its own solely describes an operation without context of the table it is performed on; when combined with a table, it becomes a `Workload`. A single table therefore produces multiple workloads, one for each spec file in its `specs/` directory.

### `ReadConfig`

Specifies runtime parameters for `Read` workloads that are not part of the spec JSON — currently whether to scan serially or in parallel, and how many threads to use. Multiple configs can be applied to the same workload to compare modes. By default all workloads run serial log replay; workloads with sidecar files additionally run parallel configs to benchmark parallel scanning.

### `WorkloadRunner`

Owns all pre-built state for a workload (e.g. a pre-constructed `Snapshot`) so that `execute()` measures only the target operation. Each runner corresponds to one `Workload` plus whatever additional configuration that workload type requires — `Read` workloads take a `ReadConfig`, while `SnapshotConstruction` workloads require no extra configuration.
